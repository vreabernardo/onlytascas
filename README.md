## Description: 

Inspired by the traditional Portuguese "Rali de Tascas", OnlyTascas is an app that crafts custom food tours based on your chosen dish, location, number of places, and radius. It maps out the best spots to taste that dish within the specified radius, optimizing your route for maximum culinary exploration and city sightseeing. 


## Google API Integration:
